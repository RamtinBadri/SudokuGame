# SudokuGame
This project consists of a very basic sudoku game which is executable in terminal. You can run the game via Sudoku.exe. Once you enter a username, it will be stored in usernames.txt, hence you won't be able to reuse it later unless you remove the contents in usernames.txt. You can save your games and continue them as long as you're logged into the account that saved those games. Also, there is a leaderboard in which you can see the scores of last users you logged into.
